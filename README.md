## Prerequisites

## Runnning the sample
# Setup

Step 1: Clone or download this repository
From your shell or command line:

git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnetcore-webapp-tutorial webapp
cd webapp
Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, that it has sub-folders and so are the name of the referenced NuGet pacakges, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

We recommend that you start by the first part 1. WebApp signs-in users with Microsoft identity (OIDC) where you will learn how to sign-in users within your own organization
It's however possible to start at any phase of the tutorial as the full code is provided in each folder.
